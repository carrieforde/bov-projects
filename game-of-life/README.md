## Tasks & Bundling
Once you have run `npm install`, you're ready to start using Game of Life's taskrunning features. Game of Life includes several `node` tasks, and bundling with Webpack.

### `npm run build`
Generates bundled files with `webpack`.

### `npm run dev`
Uses `webpack` to spin up a development server at `http://localhost:9000`, and initiates `webpack --watch`. Changes to files in `./src` will be bundled automatically, and the site will be reloaded.

### `npm run jsdoc`
Looks through JavaScript files and generates API documentation based on [JSDoc comments](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html#adding-documentation-comments-to-your-code).

### `npm run jsdocwatch`
Watches for changes to JavaScript files and automatically runs `npm run jsdoc`.

### `npm run kss`
Looks through Sass files and compiles a KSS styleguide based on Sass comments.

###  `npm run watch`
Similar to `grunt watch`. Watches for changes to `.scss` files and runs `npm run kss` automatically.

### `npm run sassdoc`
Generates Sassdoc documentation based on [Sassdoc annotations](http://sassdoc.com/annotations/) in all `.sass` and `.scss` files.

### `npm run sassdocwatch`
Watches for changes to Sass files and automatically runs `npm run sassdoc`.

### `npm run alldocs`
Generates JS API documentation, KSS styleguide, and Sassdoc documentation in one go.


## Linting
Game of Life includes Sass and JavaScript linting by default using Stylelint and ES Lint, respectively.
